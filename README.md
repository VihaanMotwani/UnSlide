# UnSlide

**UnSlide** is an AI platform that transforms sparse, context-poor lecture slides into complete, well-structured, deeply explained learning materials.

## Concept
Students often struggle with professor slides that are overly compressed or lack context. UnSlide uses AI to:
1.  **Ingest** original slide decks (PDF/PPTX).
2.  **Analyze** the content, structure, and visual elements.
3.  **Expand** the material into a coherent narrative, filling in missing context and explaining concepts deeply.
4.  **Enrich** the experience with external resources, analogies, and deep dives.

## Key Features
*   **Slide-by-Slide Expansion**: Turns bullet points into comprehensive explanations.
*   **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains the flow and intent of the original lecture.
*   **Split-View Interface**: View the original slide alongside the AI-generated "textbook" content.
*   **Resource Integration**: Auto-suggested readings, videos, and definitions.
